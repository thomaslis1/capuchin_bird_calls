# Capuchin Bird Call Detection Using CNNs

**Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, Google Colab

**Skills:** Audio Processing, Deep Learning, Spectrogram Analysis, Model Deployment

## Overview

Built a convolutional neural network to automatically detect capuchin bird calls in forest audio recordings. Trained the model on labeled 5-second spectrogram clips of bird calls and background sounds, then applied it to segment and analyze longer ambient recordings. This enabled estimation of bird call density across different forest locations for ecological monitoring.

## Key Achievements

- Preprocessed raw audio into spectrograms suitable for CNN input
- Developed a lightweight CNN architecture for binary classification of bird call presence
- Applied model inference on long forest recordings by segmenting into 5-second clips
- Managed dataset handling, model training, and inference entirely within Google Colab environment

## Outcomes

- Enabled scalable, automated detection of capuchin bird calls in natural habitats
- Provided a foundation for ecological studies on bird population density and habitat monitoring
- Gained practical experience in audio data pipelines and ML model deployment
